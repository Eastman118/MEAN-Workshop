=============

A repo for the 5 Day "App development with MEAN Stack" Workshop _[1st September 2014 - 5th September 2014]_.

**M** - MongoDB

**E** - Expressjs

**A** - Angularjs

**N** - Nodejs

## Day 1 
### Node js _[2 hours]_

We will be going through the basics of Nodejs first

* What is Nodejs
* How Javascript on the server is different from Javascript on the client 
* How Node's evented I/O works 
* Essential Node's design patterns
* NPM, what is it & how to use it

Next, we will install `node` and `npm` on our local machines and write a few programs to feel the power of Nodejs.

## Day 2
### Express js _[2 hours]_

We will going through the basics of Expressjs first

* What is Expressjs?
* How is it different from Node's native HTTP server
* Understanding middlewares
* Structuring an Expressjs application
* Different serverside templating languages

Next, we will install `express` with the help of `npm` write a few apps, with different templating engines. We will also take a look at scaffolding tools to quickly generate Express apps

## Day 3 
### MongoDB _[2 hours]_

We will go through the basics of MongoDB first

* What is MongoDB?
* What is JSON data?
* Interacting with MongoDB using mongo shell as well as MongoDB native drivers/Mongojs
* CRUD with MongoDB
* Advanced querying with MongoDB

Next, we will install `mongdb` and learn how to interact with the data using the `mongo` shell. Next, we will write an application which takes data from UI, passes it to Expressjs, saves it to MongoDB and returns the response. 

## Day 4
### Angularjs _[2 hours]_

We will go through the basics of Angularjs first

* What & Why of Angularjs
* Understanding that Angularjs is a framework and not a **"2 way data binding library"**
* Understanding Filters, Routers, Controllers and Factories

Next, we will see how to setup an Angularjs boiler plate and we will build a couple of app that are client side only as well as one app that integrates Angularjs with a REST service. 

## Day 5
### M.E.A.N. Stack App _[2 hours]_

On the final day, we will build an End to End Todo Application leveraging the M.E.A.N stack
